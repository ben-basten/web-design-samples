## About this Repository

This is a working sample of some of the projects that I have worked on. Most of the projects are just simple experimentation with new languages or libraries.

**Projects**
1. Rendering Art - Drawing shapes on an HTML5 canvas and posting the shape data to the Express js server
2. Simple Survey - Vote on a couple survey questions and keep track of the votes on the server. This uses AJAX to get survey questions to and from the server, using Vue.js to dynamically display the questions and their respective options.
3. Round Robin Scoreboard - an interactive bracket that uses AJAX and Vue responsive elements to keep track of the results of a round-robin tournament.
