## About this Repository

This is a working sample of some of the projects that I have worked on. Most of the projects are just simple experimentation with new languages or libraries.

**Projects**
1. Rendering Art - Drawing shapes on an HTML5 canvas and posting the shape data to the Express js server
2. Simple Survey - Vote on a couple survey questions and keep track of the votes on the server. This uses AJAX to get survey questions to and from the server, using Vue.js to dynamically display the questions and their respective options.
3. Round Robin Scoreboard - an interactive bracket that uses AJAX and Vue responsive elements to keep track of the results of a round-robin tournament. 
4. Tug of War - 2 player multiplayer game using Socket.io to create game lobbies with unique lobby codes for friends to join.
5. BS Scrabble - 2 player multiplayer Scrabble knockoff game using Socket.io to support multiple clients and Vue for a responsive drag-and-drop interface.
	* This was a partner final project for my "Client-Side Programming" class. I designed the client side of the game (UI, responsive Vue) and the GameBoard structure while my partner primarily worked on the server-side validation and scoring.
	* Currently, the game only supports the first 2 clients to open the page. Future enhancements could include using MongoDB to create multiple lobbies.

**How to Run the Projects**

First, make sure that Node.js is installed on your machine.

*In the local directory of each project:*

* To install Node dependencies, use the `npm install` command in the Node command prompt
* One dependencies are installed, use the `npm start` command to start the server
